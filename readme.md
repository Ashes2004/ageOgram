</p>

**AgeOgram** is a full-stack social media application designed to recommend and display posts based on the user's age group. The platform aims to create a more personalized and safe social networking experience by tailoring content feeds to the emotional and informational needs of different age demographics.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of AgeOgram is to solve the "one-size-fits-all" content problem found in traditional social platforms. By grouping users into age brackets and filtering content accordingly, AgeOgram fosters healthier interactions, reduces irrelevant content exposure, and builds micro-communities based on shared generational interests.

> AgeOgram = Safe, Smart, and Social — for every age group.
